#Note Before taking a Golden AMI run the mentioned below AWS commands on Windows EC2 instances.
<Advantage:---> if you copy your AMI to other AWS Regions, you can attach new EC2 key Pairs to it.>

"C:\ProgramData\Amazon\EC2-Windows\Launch\Scripts\SendWindowsIsReady.ps1 -Schedule"
"C:\ProgramData\Amazon\EC2-Windows\Launch\Scripts\InitializeInstance.ps1 -Schedule",
###"C:\ProgramData\Amazon\EC2-Windows\Launch\Scripts\SysprepInstance.ps1 -NoShutdown"### ---> Instance keep running

cd C:\ProgramData\Amazon\EC2-Windows\Launch\Scripts

./SysprepInstance.ps1

You are logged off the instance and the instance shuts down. If you check the Instances page in the Amazon EC2 console, the instance state changes from running to stopping, and then to stopped. At this point, it is safe to create an AMI from this instance.






Case-2 ---> Key .pem file provided ---> Windows Administrator Password not provided ---> (when Windows Administrator is changed manually by someone)
ssh-keygen -y -f Share-Point-Server.pem > Share-Point-Server.pub
